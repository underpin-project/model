DCAT
DCAT information can be presented in many forms including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in HTML pages as HTML-RDFa, or serialized as RDF/XML RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR, N3, Turtle, JSON-LD or other formats
dcat:DataService
If the Data Service refers to an endpoint that supports the Dataspace Protocol, it must include the property dspace:dataServiceType
dspace:participantId
The identifier of the participant providing the Catalog is specified using the dspace:participantId attribute on that DCAT Catalog.
ex:figure-service-006
  rdf:type dcat:DataService ;
  dcterms:conformsTo <http://dcat.example.org/apidef/figure/v1.0> ;
  dcterms:type <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceType/view> ;
  dcat:endpointDescription <http://dcat.example.org/api/figure-006/params> ;

DCAT Catalog
The Catalog is a DCAT Catalog with the following restrictions:
Each ODRL Offer must be unique to a Dataset since the target of the Offer is derived from its enclosing context.
A Catalog must not have an odrl:hasPolicy attribute, since it is not intended to negotiate on the access to Catalog objects. An implementation might however regulate the visibility and/or the content of its Catalog dependent of the requester.
